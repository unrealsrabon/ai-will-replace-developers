# The Rules Regarding This

### *Strict Rules. No Exceptions. No Shortcuts.*

---

</div>

> To keep this challenge legitimate and transparent, I follow strict rules. No exceptions. No shortcuts. No cheating.

> **If I break these rules, the entire challenge becomes meaningless.** So here they are, clearly stated for anyone to reference.

---

## ► Rule 1: AI Writes ALL Code

> **Every single line of code in every project must be written by AI.**

### What this means:
- I provide prompts describing what I want built
- AI generates the code
- I don't type, copy-paste, or manually write any code

### ▸ What I CAN do:
- Write prompts and descriptions
- Explain what features I need
- Describe the requirements and specifications

### ▸ What I CANNOT do:
- Write even a single line of code myself
- Copy code from Stack Overflow or other sources
- Modify AI-generated code manually

**→ Why this rule matters:** This is the core of the challenge. If I'm writing code, I'm not proving AI can replace developers—I'm just proving I can code with AI assistance. That's not the point.

---

## ► Rule 2: No Manual Debugging or Code Fixes

**If there's a bug, I describe the problem and let AI fix it. I don't fix it myself.**

What this means:
- When something doesn't work, I test it and describe what's wrong
- I provide error messages, expected behavior, and actual behavior to the AI
- AI analyzes the issue and implements the fix

What I CAN do:
- Test the application and find bugs
- Describe what's broken in detail
- Provide console errors, logs, or reproduction steps
- Request specific fixes or changes

What I CANNOT do:
- Edit the code to fix bugs
- Implement fixes myself "to save time"
- Manually adjust configurations or code when AI makes mistakes

**→ Why this rule matters:** If I'm fixing bugs manually, I'm developing. The challenge is that AI can handle the full development cycle, including debugging.

---

## ► Rule 3: Only Prompts and Descriptions Allowed

**My only input is natural language communication with AI.**

What this means:
- I communicate with AI through prompts, just like talking to a teammate
- All instructions are in plain English (or Bangla, or any human language)
- AI interprets my requirements and implements them in code

What I CAN do:
- Write detailed prompts
- Provide examples of what I want
- Give feedback on what AI built
- Ask AI to refine or change things

What I CANNOT do:
- Provide code snippets for AI to incorporate
- Give programming-level instructions ("change line 42 to X")
- Write pseudo-code for AI to translate

**→ Why this rule matters:** This proves that non-developers can use AI to build software. If I'm giving programming instructions, I'm still functioning as a developer.

---

## ► Rule 4: Full Transparency

**All code is public and open-source.**

What this means:
- Every project repository is public
- Anyone can review the code
- No hiding failed attempts or messy code
- Commit history is preserved

What I WILL do:
- Keep all repositories public
- Accept that people will critique the code
- Maintain clear documentation
- Publish both successes and limitations

What I will NOT do:
- Hide repositories that don't work perfectly
- Delete failed experiments
- Cherry-pick only the best projects to showcase

**→ Why this rule matters:** Transparency is the only way this challenge has credibility. If I'm hiding things, people have every right to question my claims.

---

## ► Rule 5: Projects Must Actually Work

**I only publish functional projects, not broken demos.**

What this means:
- Before publishing, I test thoroughly
- If something is broken, I have AI fix it or I don't publish it
- Published projects are ready for real-world use (within scope)

What I WILL do:
- Test every feature before publishing
- Mark projects as "beta" or "experimental" if they have limitations
- Document known issues clearly
- Ensure core functionality works as intended

What I will NOT do:
- Publish non-functional code just to inflate project count
- Claim something works when it doesn't
- Release projects that crash immediately

**→ Why this rule matters:** The challenge is that AI can build production-quality software, not just code that compiles. Functionality is the standard.

---

## ► Rule 6: Honest About Limitations

**If AI can't do something, I document it honestly.**

What this means:
- If I encounter something AI struggles with, I admit it
- If a project takes multiple attempts, I'm transparent about it
- If AI makes mistakes, I acknowledge them

What I WILL do:
- Document challenges in README files
- Admit when something takes longer than expected
- Be honest about iteration counts
- Share what didn't work

What I will NOT do:
- Pretend everything works perfectly on the first try
- Hide the messy parts of the process
- Oversell AI's capabilities beyond what I can demonstrate

**→ Why this rule matters:** Honesty makes the successes more credible. If I'm lying about limitations, why trust the claims about capabilities?

---

## ► Rule 7: No Human Developer Assistance

**I don't hire developers to help with projects.**

What this means:
- No outsourcing tricky parts to human developers
- No "getting help" from developer friends
- No paying someone to fix what AI can't handle

What I CAN do:
- Ask AI to try different approaches
- Provide more context to AI
- Break problems down into smaller pieces for AI

What I CANNOT do:
- Get a developer to write any part of the code
- Ask developers to review and fix AI's code
- Collaborate with developers on implementation

**→ Why this rule matters:** This would completely defeat the purpose. The challenge is AI replacing developers, not AI plus developers.

---

## ► Rule 8: Version Control and Documentation

**All projects use proper Git practices and documentation.**

What this means:
- Every project has a proper README
- Commit messages are clear
- Project structure is organized
- Documentation explains what the project does and how to use it

What I WILL do:
- Have AI write comprehensive documentation
- Maintain clean commit history
- Include installation and usage instructions
- Document dependencies and requirements

What I will NOT do:
- Skip documentation because "the code speaks for itself"
- Leave projects poorly organized
- Publish without proper README files

**→ Why this rule matters:** Professional software needs professional presentation. If AI can replace developers, it should maintain professional standards.

---

## ► Rule 9: Real Use Cases Only

**Projects solve actual problems or provide real functionality.**

What this means:
- No "hello world" apps to inflate counts
- Projects address genuine needs or interesting challenges
- Each project demonstrates meaningful capabilities

What I WILL build:
- Tools people can actually use
- Extensions that provide real value
- Applications that solve actual problems
- Projects that showcase AI capabilities

What I will NOT build:
- Trivial demos with no real purpose
- Example apps that don't do anything useful
- Projects that exist only to increase repository count

**→ Why this rule matters:** Anyone can have AI generate trivial code. The challenge is about building meaningful software.

---

## ► Rule 10: Open to Verification

**Anyone can challenge my claims, and I'll provide evidence.**

What this means:
- If someone questions whether AI built something, I'll explain the process
- I'm open to technical reviews of the code
- I accept feedback and criticism
- People can report if they think I'm breaking the rules

What I WILL do:
- Respond to legitimate questions about the process
- Provide more details if requested
- Accept when AI-generated code has issues
- Acknowledge valid criticism

What I will NOT do:
- Get defensive when questioned
- Dismiss all criticism as "haters"
- Refuse to provide transparency
- Block people who point out problems

**→ Why this rule matters:** A challenge without accountability isn't a challenge, it's just claims. Verification keeps this honest.

---

## ► Breaking the Rules

> If I break these rules, **the challenge is void for that project.**

> I won't make excuses. I won't justify it. If I cheat, I'll admit it and remove the project.

**That's the deal.**

---

## ► Why These Rules Exist

These rules exist because:

**1. Credibility**  
   → Without rules, anyone can claim anything

**2. Transparency**  
   → Rules make the challenge verifiable

**3. Honesty**  
   → Rules prevent me from cutting corners

**4. Fairness**  
   → Rules ensure I'm actually proving what I claim to prove

> The whole point of this challenge is to demonstrate AI capabilities honestly. If I'm breaking my own rules, I'm not demonstrating anything except dishonesty.

---

## ► Reporting Rule Violations

If you think I've broken these rules:

**1.** Open an issue in the relevant repository  
**2.** Explain which rule was violated and provide evidence  
**3.** I'll investigate and respond  

If you're right, I'll acknowledge it, fix it, or remove the project.

### ► These rules are non-negotiable

**They're what make this challenge legitimate.**

> If you're reading this thinking "these rules seem strict"—good. They should be. Otherwise, what's the point?
